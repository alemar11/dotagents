# Herdr

Herdr organizes terminals into workspaces, tabs, and panes, recognizes coding agents running inside panes, and exposes the current session through the `herdr` CLI.

The upstream `HERDR_ENV=1` check is intentionally disabled in this local copy.
Use Herdr from outside a managed pane when requested. Without inherited caller
context, discover the intended session and target explicit live IDs; do not use
`--current` or assume `HERDR_*` variables identify a caller pane. For background
work, use the intended target pane and preserve the requested working directory.

Use only when the user explicitly mentions Herdr or asks to use it. Do not use
merely because a task could benefit from a background terminal, delegation, or
parallel work.

Instructions are aligned with the [official skill](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr/blob/master/skills/herdr/SKILL.md)
(verified against Herdr 0.9.0). The installed binary remains the command-syntax
authority.

## Learn the current CLI

The installed binary is the authority for command syntax. Start with:

```bash
herdr --help
```

Then print the relevant command group by running the group without a subcommand:

```bash
herdr agent
herdr pane
herdr workspace
herdr tab
herdr worktree
herdr terminal
herdr notification
herdr integration
herdr session
herdr machine
```

Do not run bare `herdr` for discovery; it launches or attaches the TUI. Do not probe a mutating nested command by omitting arguments. Commands such as `herdr workspace create` are valid with defaults and will execute.

Most control commands return JSON. Read identifiers and state from those responses instead of predicting them.

## Understand layout, panes, and agents

Choose the primitive that matches the job:

- Workspace, tab, and pane topology organize terminal locations.
- Pane commands control raw terminals, shells, tests, servers, input, and output.
- Agent commands control the recognized coding agent currently occupying a pane.

A pane exists whether or not it contains an agent. `agent start` requires an existing available shell pane and never creates, splits, or moves layout. Use pane commands for ordinary processes. Use agent commands when Herdr must validate agent identity or interpret `idle`, `working`, `blocked`, `done`, and `unknown` lifecycle states.

Agent commands accept either a unique live agent name or the pane ID currently hosting that agent. They do not accept terminal IDs or bare agent-kind labels. Names must match `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}` and be unique among live agents. A name follows the current pane occupant and is cleared when that agent exits, is released, or is replaced.

For lifecycle interpretation and wait behavior, read [states](references/states.md).

## Use IDs and caller context

Public IDs are opaque stable handles:

- workspace: `w1`
- tab: `w1:t1`
- pane: `w1:p1`

Closed tab and pane IDs are not reused. A pane moved into another workspace receives a new workspace-qualified pane ID. After `pane move`, continue with `.result.move_result.pane.pane_id` or the live agent name. The old value is reported as `.result.move_result.previous_pane_id`; only the moved process's inherited caller context keeps resolving that old ID, so do not use it as a general agent target.

Herdr injects the caller's context into each managed pane:

```bash
printf '%s\n' "$HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID" "$HERDR_TAB_ID" "$HERDR_PANE_ID"
```

Prefer `--current` when a pane command should target the calling pane. Omitting a target may use the UI-focused pane, which can belong to the user or another client.

Discover live state with:

```bash
herdr workspace list
herdr tab list --workspace "$HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID"
herdr pane current --current
herdr pane list --workspace "$HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID"
herdr agent list
```

Creation responses expose the IDs to use next. `workspace create` returns `.result.workspace`, `.result.tab`, and `.result.root_pane`. `tab create` returns `.result.tab` and `.result.root_pane`. `pane split` returns the new pane as `.result.pane`.

IDs and live agent names are scoped to one server. Two saved SSH machines can both have `w1:p1` or an agent named `reviewer`. Selecting a machine in the TUI does not retarget commands running in your pane: they still use the inherited session and socket context. Run remote control commands on the intended host with its explicit session, and rediscover IDs there.

`herdr machine list` lists saved connection profiles, not a cross-machine pane inventory; add `--json` for scripts. Only add, remove, enable, or disable profiles when the user asks. Removing a profile disconnects the client but does not stop remote sessions. Adding a machine uses the remote default session unless `--remote-session` is explicitly supplied. Setup asks before stopping an incompatible server and defaults to No; do not approve replacement without the user's consent. Experimental handoff is not part of `machine add`.

## Agent and command operations

Before starting or coordinating an agent, or running and reading an ordinary
command in another pane, read [operations](references/operations.md). It covers
layout, startup, prompt submission, waits, input, output, and scrollback recovery.

## Safety and coordination rules

- Use `--no-focus` for background work unless the user asked to switch context.
- Use `--current`, an explicit pane ID, or a unique agent name. Do not rely on another client's focused pane.
- Parse IDs from JSON responses. Do not derive them from sidebar order or examples.
- Do not close workspaces, tabs, panes, or sessions you did not create unless the user explicitly asked. `workspace close --group` closes the primary workspace and its linked worktree workspaces; never add it merely to bypass `workspace_group_close_required`.
- Use `--trust-repository` only after the user has verified the repository. It grants per-request Git trust; it is not a routine retry for a failed worktree command.
- Client and server versions can differ after an update. Check `herdr status` before relying on new server features. A missing method is not permission to stop or upgrade a server.
- Never run `herdr server stop` from an active session unless the user explicitly intends to stop the server and its pane processes.
- Never kill the main Herdr process. Use named test sessions for experiments that need an isolated server.
- CLI server errors are JSON on stderr with exit status 1. CLI syntax errors exit with status 2.
